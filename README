      my $sc = Test::HTML::Spelling->new(
          ignore_classes   => [qw( no-spellcheck )],

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses an HTML document, and checks the spelling of the text
    and some attributes (such as the `title' and `alt' attributes).

    It will not spellcheck the attributes or contents of elements (including
    the contents of child elements) with the class `no-spellcheck'. For
    example, elements that contain user input, or placenames that are
    unlikely to be in a dictionary (such as timezones) should be in this
    class.

    It will fail when an HTML document if not well-formed.

    The following modules have similar functionality:
